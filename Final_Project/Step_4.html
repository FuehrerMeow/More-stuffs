<h1>Step 4</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>Introduction to the 4th Step Inventory Workshop
 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE 12 STEPS?
 1. To help us discover and establish a conscious relationship with a Power greater than ourselves.
 2. To help us improve our conscious relationship with a Power greater than ourselves.
 3. To produce the personality change necessary for our recovery.
 4. To provide a design for living - that can help us be happy, comfortable, and at ease, living an enjoy-
 able life of purpose, with peace and harmony with ourselves, with others, and with God as we understand
 Him, growing in understanding and effectiveness, serving and helping others - without the use of alcohol
 or other drugs.
 The precise instructions for taking the 12 Steps is contained in the book, Alcoholics Anonymous.
 “To show other alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of this book.”
 -- From the Forward to the First Edition of the book, Alcoholics Anonymous
 There is much more to life than being physically sober. There is much more to sobriety than having the
 obsession for alcohol removed. Sober isn’t much fun - unless we can learn to be happy and sober. To be happy
 and sober requires emotional sobriety. The Fourth Step is our first action step towards physical and emotional
 sobriety.
 We are in a process to recreate our lives. We made a decision to give up our old plans for living and to
 try A.A.’s 12 Step Plan for Living. The Fourth Step is our first action step. It is here that we know whether or not
 we really took Steps 1, 2 and 3.
 Step Four is a fact-finding and fact-facing process. We are searching for “causes and conditions.” We
 want to uncover the truth about ourselves. We want to discover the attitudes, thoughts, beliefs, fears, actions,
 behaviors, and the behavior patterns - that have been blocking us, causing us problems and causing our failure.
 We want to learn the exact nature our “character defects” and what causes us to do the unacceptable things we
 do - so that once they are removed - we can acquire and live with new attitudes, thoughts, beliefs, actions and
 behaviors for our highest good, and for the highest good of those with whom we come in contact. This prepares
 us to live a life of purpose - where we can be in maximum fit condition to be of service to others. And, by taking
 inventory and learning the exact nature of our wrongs - we will be able to recognize when we might be slipping
 into our old way of life - and headed for new problems, and possibly relapse.
 If you doubt that you have any problems -- just think back to the last time that you felt restless,
 irritable and discontented. Remember when you got angry - with your self or with another person. Remember the
 last time you were disturbed. Remember the last time you had a problem or troubles. The last time you felt
 uncomfortable and not at ease in a situation. What was it? Whom was it with? What happened?
 Everything contained in the Fourth Step Inventory Worksheets is directly from the book - Alcoholics
 Anonymous. The worksheets were created by using the precise instructions in the Big Book to make taking
 the Fourth Step as easy and simple as possible. All page numbers in this Fourth Step Inventory Workshop,
 refer to the third edition of the book - Alcoholics Anonymous. If you are using the fourth edition -- make sure you
 are on the correct page.
 FOURTH STEP INVENTORY INSTRUCTIONS
 1. Be sure that you have taken Steps One, Two and Three.
 3. If you are using the forms that I provided to you, or if you’re not using the forms, remember: The columns
 go from TOP to BOTTOM. Not straight across. Example: Column 1, (left column) list all the names, people,
 principles, things, etcetera, that go in this first column, top to bottom. DO NOT move to the second column
 until column 1 is complete. Then, when you do column 2, go top to bottom, not straight across, until you
 have completed column 2. Do the same with each successive column. Top to Bottom. Not straight across
 4. Read page 58 through 63 of the Big Book (up to the last paragraph). Note each place you see the word
 “self” and “selves” and the compounds of those words. (Example “self-seeking, self-reliance” etcetera).
 5. There are four parts to your Inventory. They are to be taken in the precise order as numbered below:
 1. Resentments 2. Fears 3. Sex Conduct 4. Harms To Others
 6. Now, read page 63 (starting with the last paragraph) - through page 71 of the Big Book.
 7. Complete the four different Inventory sheets that have been provided to you. Follow the instructions on
 each of the sheets. Use additional copies of the sheets when necessary. DO NOT complete the
 columns left to right -- they should be completed from TOP to BOTTOM in each column, before going
 to the next column.
 8. Refer to the “Prompt Sheets” to jog your memory -- if you get stuck.
 9. Ask questions if you are unsure of anything! Prepare for a long talk with your sponsor.
 10. In this Fourth Step Inventory we are searching for our grosser handicaps. Personal inventories will become
 part of a life-long process. Later, in our Tenth Step Inventories, our objectives are not only to keep our
 “house clean and in order” -- correcting mistakes and errors when they occur -- but also to grow in
 understanding and effectiveness. At that point many of us find it interesting to discover in greater depth a
 knowledge and understanding of ourselves, our instincts, impulses and drives. In our Daily 10th & 11th
 Steps, we will begin to look at the “Assets and Liabilities” in our lives which will provide a simple “Design for
 Living” that we’ll use to “Recreate our lives.”
 Naturally, there will come to mind additional things that you will feel that you should have included in your
 Fourth Step, that were left out. Don’t worry about it. If you take these Steps as they have been layed out, and
 you have been thorough to the best of your ability at the time that you took them -- you will have plenty of time
 later on to revisit the Fourth Step, using the 10th Step Inventories. And, you’ll be able to do it SOBER!!!
 You are learning to use our “Spiritual Tools” for the first time. You will use them daily (hopefully) for the rest of
 your life........... as you trudge the road of happy destiny, with a new peace, serenity, attitude, and new outlook
 on life!

 Note: I suggest that you take this step with a qualified sponsor. A qualified sponsor – is someone
 who has taken ALL 12 Steps precisely following the directions as they are defined and described in
 the Big Book – Alcoholics Anonymous. IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO DO THIS STEP ALONE. Be sure
 your Sponsor is present and leading you through this Step as you take it. (That’s one of the reasons
 that we have sponsors! And, it is your sponsors job to lead you through this Step)
 Self Esteem - How I think of myself
 Pride - How I think others view me
 Pocketbook - Basic desire for money, property, possessions, etc.
 Personal Relations - Our relations with other people.
 Emotional Security - General sense of emotional well being
 Sex Relations - Basic drive for sexual intimacy
 Selfish, self-centered, egotistical - “It’s about me!”
 Ambitions - Our goals, plans and designs for the future. Ambition deals with
 the things that we want. In examining our ambitions we notice that we have the
 following types:
 Emotional ambitions. Our ambitions for Emotional Security. Our “feelings”.
 Material ambitions - Our ambitions for “Our pocketbook.” Our ambitions
 towards physical and financial well-being.
 Social ambitions - Our “place or position in the herd.” Our ambitions of
 how others view us. Our ambitions towards what people think about us.
 Sexual ambitions - Refers to ambitions for sex relations. Does this really
 need a definition?
