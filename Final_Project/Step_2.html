<h1>Step 2</h1>


<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>http://stepsbybigbook.net Step 2 29
 SESSION 6
 STEP 2 We Agnostics
 Step 2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to
 sanity.
 Willing to believe…cornerstone [of a] spiritual structure. (47: 2)
 Burn the idea into the consciousness of every man that he can get well
 regardless of anyone. (98: 2)
 Step 2 written inventory
 Take Step 2
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read Chapter 4, We Agnostics and Appendix II. Many will read Step 2
 in the 12&12.
 WRITE Write about your reflections on the chapter. Spirituality is taking the
 focus off of us, being more considerate of others, and awakening to a life already
 connected to a higher power. You may want to consider these questions:
 o Do I believe that I can be restored to wholeness?
 o How can I see a higher power working in my life?
 o What characteristics does my higher power NOT have?
 o What characteristics DOES my higher power have? This is sufficient to begin.
 TALK Call your sponsor and other group members to discuss your thoughts on
 the chapter.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH MEDITATION / PRAYER
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 2?
 What's the point of Step 2? The point is (60: 1) that we can get well, or more well.
 We can be restored to sanity, to wholeness. We can come to have faith in this
 hope, even when our disease says, "There is no hope for me, I might as well use."
 Step 2 reminds us that it is crazy to think we needed to be so much in control.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider pp. 44: 1,3; 45: 1,2,3; 47: 1; 52: 1,2,3; 567-8)
 1.) Am I willing?
 Can I believe that other alcoholics have found peace of mind through this
 process?
 What is it, precisely and in detail, that I have worshipped? (54: 1)
 What, exactly, have I experienced? (55: 2-3)
 Am I willing to consider that I am not at the core of everything – good or bad –
 and hence there may be a power greater than any one of us?
 Was I insane or crazy to believe the lies the alcohol told me?
 2.) My Problem
 What do these definitions of alcoholism mean to me?:
 - when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit entirely [Mind]
 - when drinking, you have little control over the amount you take. [Body] (44: 1)
 If being crazy or insanity is a loss of perspective and proportion (5: 5; 37: 1), how
 is this like denial, dishonesty, or lack of humility? [12&12 pp. 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]
 In what areas of my life do I need sanity now?
 In what ways am I addicted to my painful and insane ways of thinking and
 reacting?
 3.) My Solution
 How do I react when the authors tell me that we must find a spiritual basis in life
 – or else? (44: 3) In what ways am I spiritual?
 What does this mean to me: the Big Book’s main object is to enable you to find a
 Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem? (45: 2)
 4.) My Own Conception of a Higher Power
 What do the terms ‘agnostic,’ ‘we came to believe’ and ‘restore us to sanity’
 mean to me? (See 55: 1-4, 57: 0)
 How does my childhood training about God affect my life and recovery today?
 (45: 3)
 What does it mean when the authors of the Big Book say, When, therefore, we
 speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God? This applies, too, to
 other spiritual expressions…. What [do] they mean to you? (47: 1)
 What does work mean, as in, Is not our age characterized by the ease with which
 we discard old ideas for new,…throw away the theory or gadget which does not
 work for something new which does? (52: 1)
 What works and does not work in my life to give me serenity and peace of mind?
 For me, how is it that, Our ideas did not work. But the God idea did? (52: 3)
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 2 PRINCIPLES
 How may I practice my new belief that I can get well or more well?
 How may I know that help is available, that I am not entirely alone?
 How may I stop relying on my own thinking and begin to ask for help today?
 How may I be willing to grow along spiritual lines? (60: 1)
 Have I sought help from my sponsor, gone to meetings, and reached out to other
 recovering alcoholics? What were the results?
 May I find a sign of a higher power in the support I receive from the fellowship?

 IV TAKE STEP 2 We take Step 2 in the second paragraph of BB page 47.
 Do I now believe, or am I even willing to believe, that there is a Power greater
 than myself? (47: 2) ...Willing to get well. (97: 4-98: 0)
 When we assent, then according to the Big Book and under the conditions of this
 day, we take Step 2. Keep in mind that our reasonable best is always more than good
 enough. Some groups mark taking Step 2 by holding hands and reciting the Step.
 STEP 2 Written Inventory
 Step 2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to
 sanity.
 Consider these questions, which are borrowed from meetings and recovery literature.
 Add your own as appropriate. Consider responding in detail with specific examples,
 rather than rote yes's or no's.
 Insanity
 What is my understanding of my own sanity and insanity? [The Big Book authors define
 sanity as sane and sound. (69: 2) [healthy, whole] Insanity is a lack of proportion, of the
