<h1>Step 5</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 13
 STEP 5 Into Action pp 72 – 75
 Step 5 Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature
 of our wrongs.
 We have a written inventory and we are prepared for a long talk. (75: 1)
 Step 5 written inventory Take Step 5
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read about Step 5 in Chapter 6, Into Action, pp. 72 – 75. Many read
 Step 5 in the 12 & 12. Step 5 is a step out of our isolation.
 WRITE Review the work you did on Step 4. Steps 4 and 5 are action Steps that
 explore denial and self-deception, and contribute to self acceptance. Have you left
 anything out? Write it down.
 TALK Find someone with whom to take Step 5. Let your higher power guide
 you in finding the right person in the program. You may choose to share different
 parts of your story with different people. Make an appointment and take the Step.
 PRACTICE DAILY MEDITATION / PRAYER We are not alone.
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 5?
 We may read and discuss Chapter 6, pp. 72- 75 having to do with Step 5.
 The actual taking of Step 5 is private and will not occur within the group.
 However, group members may speak generally about their experiences and share
 some of their reflective writings about taking Step 5 by the Big Book.
 Suggestion: Be specific and thorough when responding to the session questions.
 Try to avoid rote 'yes' and 'no' answers.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 72-75: 3) Cross off the bulleted points.
 1.) We are only as sick as our secrets.
 a.) Fear
 Step 4 and Step 5 are the most discussed and the most skipped Steps. Why?
 Do I have any fears or reservations about doing this Step? What are they?
 How has working the first four Steps prepared me for taking Step 5?
 Was I so numb that I did not realize my wrongs?
 b.) Admitted to God [of our own understanding]
 Have I opened myself to the presence of a higher power before going over my
 inventory with my Fifth Step sponsor? How do I do this?
 How is my Third Step decision reaffirmed by working the Fifth Step?
 c.) Admitted…to ourselves
 How am I very much the actor? (73: 1)
 Had I been under constant fear and tension, and did that make for more drinking?
 (73: 2)
 d.) Admitted…to another human being
 What may happen to those who hang on to some of the worst items in stock, or
 have not told someone else all their life story? (73: 0)
 How will working Step 5 help me to begin to develop new ways of having
 relationships?
 Am I in complete readiness to talk to the right person, (74: 2) and to listen to their
 response?
 2.) The exact nature of our wrongs
 Can I …get down to causes and conditions? (64: 0)
 Have I inventoried my grosser handicaps? (71: 0)
 What does the exact nature of our defects mean? (72: 1) What is behind my
 alcoholism and the reasons I acted out in the ways I did?
 Why do I need to admit the exact nature – my own basic starting point / motive –
 of my wrongs and not simply the wrongs themselves?
 What is the distinction between my motives (86: 2) and my actions or behaviors?
 The 5th Step promises: Do I now feel I can look the world in the eye? (75: 2)
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 5 PRINCIPLES
 How may I practice being honest with myself, accepting who I am, both the good
 and the harm that I do, and living up to my potential?
 Where am I responsible and where am I not responsible? What patterns would I
 rather not repeat in the future?
 How may I practice the courage to share the parts of myself that should never see
 the light of day? (73: 2)
 How may I practice being committed to trusting this process, trusting another
 person, and trusting myself to do it?
 How may I practice relying on my higher power, relying on the program of
 recovery and relying on the fellowship?

 IV TAKE STEP 5
 When we decide who is to hear our story, we waste no time…. We pocket our
 pride and go to it, illuminating every twist of character, every dark cranny of the past.
 (75: 1, 2)
 When we have admitted to God of our understanding, to ourselves, and to another
 human being the exact nature of our wrongs, then according to the Big Book and under
 the conditions of this day, we have taken Step 5.
 An optional written Step 5 inventory is on p. 91 of this workbook. The actual
 taking of this Step will occur outside the group. The group may decide to observe taking
 Step 5 in a manner similar to the way some AA groups celebrate anniversaries.
 STEP 5 WRITTEN INVENTORY [optional] (Step 8 inventory on reverse)

 nature of our wrongs.

 and the reasons I acted out in the ways I did?

 the light of day? (73: 2)

 make the amends.)
