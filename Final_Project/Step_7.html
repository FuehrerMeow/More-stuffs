<h1>Step 7</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 15
 STEP 7 Into Action p. 76: 2
 Step 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
 Let God [of our understanding] (76: 1) Grant me strength. (76: 2)
 Step 7 written inventory Take Step 7
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read Chapter 6, Into Action p. 76, paragraph 2 on Step 7. [See also
 265: 0, 1, 2] Many also read Step 7 in the 12&12.
 o Heard in a meeting: “Humility is our acceptance of who and what we really
 are, that we are worthwhile, and that we are grateful.”
 WRITE Write about the character defects and shortcomings you act out on, and
 the spiritual principles you might use instead. [Shortcoming: Failure to hit a
 target. To miss the mark. Out of bounds.]
 o Heard in a meeting: “Our defects are never completely removed, but rather
 replaced with other attributes (God Given!).”
 TALK Talk with your sponsor and other members of the group about your
 experiences with Step 7. Discuss your character defects and what you are doing
 about them.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION MEDITATION / PRAYER
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 7?
 We may read p. 76: 2 Chapter 6, Into Action on Step 7. Members of the group
 may be asked to share their experience, strength, and hope on Step 7 by the Big
 Book. We may each share our writings on Step 7 in a round robin format.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 76: 2)
 1.) Humbly: The action of humility
 How has “my way” landed me in difficulty?
 Am I acting as my own higher power? [See quit playing God, BB, 62: 3]
 How does my usefulness to myself and others depend on my being balanced?
 How does my gratitude for my life in recovery relate to my staying right size?
 How may I take a new perspective on the world and so act differently?
 How may I grow to have “solution-based” thinking?
 How is humility (55: 4) related to honesty (58: 1) and sanity (5: 5; 37: 1) in
 regards to my own sense of proportion and perspective?
 AA literature focuses on humility as seeing things in true perspective, as they
 really are. [Optional, see also 12&12 pp. 48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]
 Humility is a sense of our own humanness. We are truly just trying our best.
 2.) Asked Him : Meditation / Prayer
 How does the spiritual principle of surrender apply to getting out of the way so a
 higher power of my understanding can work in my life?
 Have I asked other recovering alcoholics to help me by sharing their experience,
 strength, and hope in this matter of prayer and meditation?
 How is the Serenity Prayer (12&12, 41: 0; 125: 2) an expression of Step 7?
 Do I work very hard to act „on target,‟ in ways that oppose my shortcomings?
 Does my higher power do Steps 6 and 7 for me?
 3.) Remove our shortcomings: Practice
 Why are defects of character in Step 6 called shortcomings in Step 7? (59: 2)
 How is my self-centered fear the chief activator of my character defects? [12&12
 76: 2]
 Can I see the many faces of my fear (my defects) and not deny or overlook them?
 How may I recognize my fear and/or anger, bring it to awareness, and deal with it
 in a healthy manner? Can I ask for help to change my fears?
 How can I stop building walls, and act instead as if I want to be happy, serene and
 sane?
 Am I prepared to take an active role in the new and healthier world that I am now
 a part of?
 Can I ask for the strength to do the practice? What does the term „practice‟ mean
 to me?
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 7 PRINCIPLES
 Has my sense of perspective been out of proportion lately?
 How may I accept my powerlessness over my shortcomings as well as my
 alcoholism?
 How may I humbly ask for strength, practice spiritual principles, and get out of
 my higher power‟s way?
 Can I become more conscious of my motives and intentions before I act?
 Instead of fear and anger, can I respond with love and patience?
 May I practice trust and being worthy, by practicing being responsible?
 Today, can I do what the alcoholic in me says, “I don‟t want to do”?
 Have there been times when I have been able to refrain from acting on a character
 defect and to practice a spiritual principle instead? Do I recognize this as the
 higher power of my understanding working in my life?

 IV TAKE STEP 7 We take Step 7 in the second paragraph on BB page 76.
 See page 96 of this workbook for an optional Step 7 written inventory.
 Under the conditions of this day, and according to the Big Book, we take Step 7.
 You may mark taking Step 7 in the manner you and your group choose. Some form a
 circle and recite the powerful Step 7 prayer together.
