<h1>Step 10</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 18
 STEP 10 Into Action pp. 84 - 85
 Step 10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly
 admitted it.
 A daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. (85: 1)
 Daily Step 10 written inventory Take Step 10
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read Chapter 6 Into Action pages 83- 85 in the Big Book. Many read
 Step 10 in the 12&12. What does it mean that ‘the Promises’ directly precede
 Step 10 in the Big Book?
 WRITE Continue your written journal of your reflections. ~Go deeper with a
 feeling before trying to make it go away. ~If you choose to act out on your
 feelings in a vengeful or manipulative way, you may have some regrets later on.
 ~If you are upset your emotional reactions are real and therefore valid, no matter
 what they are. ~What might your anger-sadness-fear be covering up?
 TALK Talk with your sponsor and other members of your group. Step 10
 combines self examination (inventory) with making amends.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH MEDITATION / PRAYER
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me about
 my practice of Step 10?
 We may share our reflections. One or more members of the group may choose to
 speak on Step 10 by the Big Book.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 84: 2-85: 2)
 1.) Continued to take personal inventory
 How may I work Step 10 to keep me within this day?
 What did I do today that worked and did not work to give me and others serenity
 and peace of mind? (84: 2) (See page 40 this workbook for Step 10 inventory.)
 Can I determine my responsibility and do what is necessary to set things straight,
 and let go of the outcome?
 2.) When we were wrong, promptly admitted it.
 Have I been resentful, selfish, dishonest, or afraid today? (84: 2)
 Today have I allowed myself to become too Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired?
 Have I kept something to myself that I should have discussed with my sponsor?
 Was there fear in my life today? (84: 2)
 Have I harmed others, directly, or indirectly, today? How?
 Do I owe any apologies or amends? Where was I wrong [twisted]? (84: 2)
 Was I out of bounds? Did I make mistakes; miss the mark?
 If I could do it over again, what would I do differently?
 How might I do better next time?
 3.) We have entered the world of the spirit. (84: 2) Watch. Ask. Turn.
 Do I watch for my selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear as I go through
 the day? (84: 2)
 Do I ask a higher power of my understanding to remove these at once, because I
 am now watching and I am starting to be awake? (84: 2)
 Do I turn that force of my self-willfulness toward good for others? (84: 2)
 4.) Step 10 promises
 Have I ceased fighting anything or anyone – even alcohol? (84: 3)
 Have I been restored to sanity? (85: 0) Is this the sanity of Step 2?
 Has my spiritual malady been overcome; have I straightened out mentally
 (meaning the obsession of the mind that takes me to a drink)? (See 64: 3)
 Am I …recovered…? (17: 1)
 5.) We are not cured of alcoholism (85: 1)
 Is it enough for me just to stay sober? Have I been letting up on my spiritual
 program of action and resting on my laurels? (85: 1)
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 10 PRINCIPLES
 How may I not forget how important my happiness and my comfort (my serenity
 and peace of mind) are, one day at a time?
 How may I do the work of recovery, regardless of how I feel?
 How may I be honest with myself, about myself, while an event is still
 happening?
 When I make a mistake do I think I am the mistake, or that it was human error?
 What have I done today about which I feel positive?
 How may I know which principles I need to practice in a given situation?

 IV TAKE STEP 10 ON A DAILY BASIS
 We take Step 10 in the second paragraph on BB page 84.
 We continue to take personal inventory and continue to set right any new mistakes as
 we go along. (84: 2)
 According to the Big Book and under the conditions of this day, we practice Step 10 on a
 daily basis.
 Acknowledge taking Step 10 in the manner that you and your group see fit.
 See page 40 of this workbook for the optional Step 10 Daily Written Inventory (Assets
 and Liabilities Checklist.)
