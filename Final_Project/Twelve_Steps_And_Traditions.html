<h1>Twelve Steps And Traditions</h1>


<p>The AA 12 Steps are the essential principles of Alcohol Anonymous’ recovery program, designed to
    help guide alcoholics through the overwhelming process of reclaiming their sobriety. Grounded in a spiritual
    approach, the 12 Steps serve as a roadmap for those battling alcoholism, not only on their journey
    to recovery but also to throughout the rest of their lives. They offer a means of support and accountability
    for addicts looking to get—and stay—clean. The 12 Steps were written as reflections on how founding
    AA members coped with and overcame their struggles with alcohol. These reflections have since turned into
    a working methodology for alcoholics to use as they work toward recovery.</p>

<h2>The 12 Steps of A.A. are as follows:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
    <li>2. We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
    <li>3. We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
    <li>4. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
    <li>5. We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongdoings.</li>
    <li>6. We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
    <li>7. We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
    <li>8. We made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
    <li>9. We made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
    <li>10. We continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
    <li>11. We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him,
        praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
    <li>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to
        alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the 12 Steps of AA are designed for individuals working toward sobriety,
    the 12 Traditions of AA address Alcoholics Anonymous and its members as an
    entire body. They’re the guidelines that inform the direction and operating
    procedures of the AA organization, and they help ensure continuity among
    all of the member groups worldwide.</p>

<h2>These are the 12 Traditions Of A.A.:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA.</li>
    <li>2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express
        Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
    <li>3. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.</li>
    <li>4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole.</li>
    <li>5. Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.</li>
    <li>6. An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside
        enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li>
    <li>7. Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li>
    <li>8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service
        centers may employ special workers.</li>
    <li>9. AA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees
        directly responsible to those they serve.</li>
    <li>10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues, hence the AA name ought
        never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
    <li>11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we
        need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films.</li>
    <li>12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever
        reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>
</ul>
