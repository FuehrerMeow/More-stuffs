<h1>Step 8</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 16
 STEP 8 Into Action pp. 76 - 84
 Step 8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make
 amends to them all.
 Like a tornado roaring his way through the lives of others. (82: 3)
 Step 8 written inventory Take Step 8
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read pp. 76 - 84 in Chapter 6, Into Action on Steps 8 and 9. Many will
 read Step 8 in the 12&12. We are learning how to live in partnership with all men
 and women.
 WRITE Make a list of all people you have harmed. Write down what you did to
 those people. Put down what an amends might be.
 o Do not yet concern yourself now with whether or not you should, or will
 be able to, actually make the amends.
 TALK Talk with your sponsor and with other members of the group about
 whom to include on your list of amends. Step 8 is part action and part attitude:
 first you make a list; second you become willing.
 o Talk with your sponsor about what an amends might look like. (76: 3)
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH PRAYER / MEDITATION
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 8?
 We read selections from Into Action pp. 76-84 together. We share our writings.
 Without mentioning names, we talk about those we included on our list.
 Does my list have too many, or too few, people on it? Have I included everyone I
 have ever interacted with? Did I only include people I committed egregious acts
 against?
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 76: 3-77: 1; 78: 2-79: 0; 80: 5; 83: 2, 3)
 1.) All persons we had harmed– Where had I been at fault?
 How may I be clear to myself about my responsibility in the wrongs I have done?
 [Responsible: Able to respond, soberly and appropriately. Accountable. Reliable.]
 How may I accept my responsibility to other people, yet not accept responsibility
 for other people?
 May I let go of the feeling of responsibility for the way certain people treated me?
 Do I owe amends to people who have also harmed me? (77: 1)
 Have I put my own name on the top of my list of people I have harmed? Why or
 why not? [see 12&12, 79: 3-80: 0, 1]
 2.) What harms have I committed against the people on my list?
 -Business acquaintances: (76: 4) Did I not cooperate with others or not put in a
 day’s work? Did I pad expense accounts or steal money?
 -Friends we have hurt. (76: 4) Have I gossiped or been emotionally unavailable?
 Have I stolen from them? Have I failed to keep in contact?
 -Those we hate. (77: 1) Have I wished ill-will upon them? Have I spoken badly of
 them? Have I committed the harms described above?
 -Our creditors: We owe money. (78: 2) Have I failed to admit that money or
 services are owed? Have I failed to make arrangements to pay what is owed?
 -Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense. (78: 3) Have I paid my fine and
 done my time? Have I made a commitment not to repeat those crimes?
 -We have domestic troubles. (80: 5) The family, (83: 1) spouse, or parents. (82: 2)
 Have I physically / emotionally / verbally abused my spouse, children, or other
 family members? Have I been emotionally unavailable to those family members?
 -Some people cannot be seen. (82: 3) Have I done any or all of the above to
 those I cannot locate or who have died?
 3.) Willing to make amends to them all
 What have I done to become willing to make these amends?
 Why am I not willing to make amends with some of the people on my list? Do I
 have fear of making direct amends? Do I have persistent resentment toward
 some? Am I unable to see the harm I have caused?
 In making amends, am I still trying to please, or control, or punish, or behave in
 some other way that interferes with an honest relationship? Will it help to revisit
 Steps 4 and 5, and Steps 6 and 7 about these issues?
 What would my life be like if I had already made these amends?
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 8 PRINCIPLES
 How may I move beyond my resentments, and blaming others, and believing I
 was the innocent victim, and all my other justifications for the harms I caused?
 Are there any names I have not added to my list? Am I willing to add them now?
 Am I beginning to feel compassion and empathy for others, including myself?
 Describe.
 How may I have peace with my past, so that I may have peace in the present and
 future?

 IV TAKE STEP 8: WRITE THE LIST
 We take Step 8 in the third paragraph of BB page 76.
 See page 92 of this SbBB workbook for the optional Step 8 written inventory.
 When we have finished writing the list of people we have harmed, then according to the
 Big Book and under the conditions of this day, we have taken Step 8.
 Observe taking Step 8 in the manner that you and your group choose.</p>
