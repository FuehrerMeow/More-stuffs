<h1>Step 11</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 19
 STEP 11 Into Action pp. 85 – 88
 Step 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact
 with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and
 the power to carry that out.
 We pause…and ask.... (87: 3) It works – it really does. (88: 1)
 Take Step 11
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read from Chapter 6, Into Action the bottom of page 85 to the end of
 the chapter. Many read Step 11 in the 12&12.
 WRITE Continue to write your daily reflections. Continue to make your Step
 9 amends, and to take a Step 10 daily inventory.
 TALK Continue to discuss your work with your sponsor and other group
 members.
 o Heard in a meeting: “Being spiritual is being open minded and looking for the
 gifts in things.”
 o Heard in a meeting: “I pray to be who I am and all I am (and not somebody
 different) – to get a better and clearer sense of my place in the universe.”
 PRACTICE DAILY MEDITATION / PRAYER Meditation and prayer, like
 other tools of recovery, are intensely practical. Like all tools, they work better the
 more we use them. See an optional relaxation practice on p. 14 of this workbook.
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 11?
 We review the three meditation / prayer practices of Step 11, BB pp. 85 - 88.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 85: 3-88: 3)
 1.) Prayer and meditation
 Step 11 begins with the word sought (59: 2), the past tense of “to seek”; how and
 what am I seeking? Do I have a specific spiritual path?
 What is my understanding of the differences between religion and spirituality?
 What have I done to explore my own spirituality?
 Do I recognize that a moment of silence is meditation, where I may quiet my
 mind on a regular basis so that I can gain understanding and knowledge from my
 higher power – my own unsuspected inner resource? (567: 4)
 Heard in a meeting: “Prayer is talking to. Meditation is listening for.”
 [Optional: „Thy will not mine, be done.’ … Just saying it over and over will often
 enable us to clear a channel choked up with anger, fear, frustration, or
 misunderstanding, and permit us to return to the surest help of all – our search
 for God [of our understanding]’s will, not our own, in the moment of stress.
 12&12, 103: 0]
 2.) Conscious contact
 The Big Book authors speak of the Retire at night meditation / prayer (86:1):
 …Review our day. Were we resentful, selfish, dishonest, or afraid?
 Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? … After making our review we
 ask God [of our understanding]’s forgiveness and inquire, what corrective
 measures should be taken? (86: 1)
 There also is the On awakening meditation / prayer (86: 2, 3 - 87: 0, 1, 2): We
 ask God [of our understanding] to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be
 divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. (86: 2)
 We ask for freedom from self-will…. (87: 1)
 Be quick to see where religious people are right. (87: 2)
 And, there is the Through the day meditation / prayer (87: 3 - 88: 0): …We
 pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action. We
 constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly saying to
 ourselves many times each day ‘Thy will be done.‟ (87: 3 - 88: 0)
 3.) The power to carry that out.
 Why do we pray only for knowledge of God's will for us and the power to carry
 that out? (59: 2)
 How does humility apply to this?
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 11 PRINCIPLES
 How may I clear away my insistence that I want or I need something, and let
 things be?
 How may I remember that I am not in charge of the world?
 How may I have the faith and courage to seek the knowledge, the will and the
 power to live my life in a way that brings serenity and peace of mind?
 How may I pass on to others my inner knowing of creation‟s deep wish of well
 being for me and others?
 How may I make a commitment to the practice of regular meditation and prayer?
 Have I meditated and prayed today?
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 IV TAKE STEP 11 ON A DAILY BASIS.
 We take Step 11 in the first three paragraphs on BB page 86.
 We ask God [of our understanding]…. (86: 1, 2, 3)
 According to the Big Book and under the conditions of this day, we practice Step
 11 on a daily basis. Take Step 11 in the manner that you and your group see fit. Some
 recite the Step or read an 11th Step prayer.
