<h1>Step 12</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 20
 STEP 12 Working With Others pp. 89 - 103
 Step 12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to
 carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
 …Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery. (97: 1)
 …Trust in God and clean house…. (98: 2)
 Take Step 12
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ We read Chapter 7, Working With Others. Many will read Step 12 in
 the 12&12.
 WRITE We write our daily reflections. We continue making our Step 9
 amends. We do Step 10 spot-check inventories, and we may work at annual or
 semi-annual inventories of all Steps. We practice Step 11 meditation / prayer.
 TALK We talk with our sponsor and new comers. We carry the message.
 o Heard in a meeting: “The message of Step 12 is not „You should get sober,‟
 but rather „Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps….‟”
 (60: 0)
 o Heard in a meeting: “We carry the message; we cannot carry the drunk.”
 PRACTICE DAILY PRAYER / MEDITATION. We practice Step 11
 conscious contact with the higher power of our understanding on a daily basis.
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 12?
 We may read and discuss Chapter 7, Working With Others. One or more members of the
 group might share their experiences with Step 12 of the Big Book.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Read BB Chapter 7. See pp. 109-110 this workbook.)
 1.) Spiritual awakening as the result
 What is my overall experience as a result of working the Steps?
 By doing my own work in Steps 1 through 11, have I developed a new way of
 thinking, feeling and acting, and connecting with others?
 Is it my experience that I have undergone a profound alteration in [my] reaction
 to life? (567: 4)
 Have I had a personality change sufficient to bring about recovery? (567: 1)
 What lasting changes have resulted from my spiritual awakening?
 Having awakened to the reality that I too am a good and caring person, can I
 invite others to see themselves the way that a loving higher power might see
 them, rather than from their own distorted or antagonistic outlook?
 2.) Carry this message
 What is this message that is referred to in Step 12? (60: 0) (See also 17: 3; 45: 2;
 77: 0; 89: 1.)
 In my experience, does this message include that there is hope, we are not alone,
 we can stay sober, and we can recover?
 Did someone carry the message to me? (See p. 18: 4,5)
 Why was an AA member able to reach me in a way that no one else ever had?
 What kind of service work am I doing today to carry the message?
 What are the step-by-step requirements for Twelfth Step work? (See BB Chapter
 7, and this SbBB workbook pp. 109 - 110)
 May I share who I am, where I have come from, and how it is for me now?
 3.) Practice these principles
 What does it mean to me to practice? (60: 0) Does it mean „to keep trying‟?
 What does it mean to practice these principles (60: 0) in all my affairs?
 Do I find life offering opportunities to repeatedly experience my old
 shortcomings, my old patterns, my old behaviors, my old actor‟s roles (60: 4), my
 old thought-habits and my old motives (86: 2), but each time with new
 understanding?
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 12 PRINCIPLES
 How may I deeply wish that others, including myself, may be happy, joyous, and
 free?
 How may I understand that sometimes the best way of loving and helping is to
 stop enabling someone else to drink?
 What is my attitude about sponsorship? What is my attitude about service?
 How may I practice spiritual principles, such as compassion, regardless of how I
 feel?
 If my disease is often expressed as self-centeredness, how may I express my
 recovery as selfless service?

 IV WORK STEP 12 ON A DAILY BASIS
 We take Step 12 in the first paragraph on BB page 89.
 A group reading of the last portion of Chapter 11, A Vision for You, is a fitting way to
 end these Steps by the Big Book group sessions. (164: 2, 3, 4)
 [Heard in a meeting: “If you want to be happy, serve others.”
 "How may we alcoholics live happy, joyous, and free? (133: 0)
 o “Happiness is being free of suffering – free of our mind's tortured reactions to
 the things that may hurt or frighten us.
 o “Joy is taking grateful delight in another's happiness, including our own.
 o “Freedom is the reprieve from grasping onto our self-centered
 alcoholism/addiction, our self-absorption, just for today."]
 STEP 12 PASS THIS ON (94: 1) PRINCIPLES FROM THE BIG BOOK
 …When all other measures failed, work with another alcoholic
 would save the day. (Bill’s Story, 15: 1)
 This is our twelfth suggestion: Carry this message to other alcoholics! You can help
 when no one else can. (89: 1)
 . . .
 When you discover a prospect for Alcoholics Anonymous, find out all you can
 about him. (90: 1)
 Realizing [you] are dealing with a sick person. … Put yourself in his place. (90:
 1,2) So cooperate; never criticize. (89: 3)
 Don't deal with him when he is very drunk.... (90: 3)
 If he does not want to see you, never force yourself upon him. (90: 4)
 You might place this book where he can see it in the interval. (90: 4)
 See your man alone [without…family], if possible. (91: 3)
 . . .
 Tell him enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences to
 encourage him to speak of himself. If he wishes to talk, let him do so. (91: 3)
 …Give him a sketch of your drinking career up to the time you quit. But say
 nothing, for the moment, of how that was accomplished. (91: 3)
 When he sees you know all about the drinking game, commence to describe
 yourself as an alcoholic. (91: 4)
 Give him an account of the struggles you made to stop. (92: 0)
 Show him the mental twist which leads to the first drink of a spree. (92: 0)
 . . .
 And be careful not to brand him as an alcoholic. (92: 1)
 If he sticks to the idea that he can still control his drinking, tell him that possibly
 he can - if he is not too alcoholic. But insist that if he is severely afflicted, there
 may be little chance he can recover by himself. (92: 1)
 Continue to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a fatal malady. (92: 2)
 Talk about the conditions of body and mind which accompany it. (92: 2)
 Even though your protégé may not have entirely admitted his condition, he has
 become very curious to know how you got well. Let him ask you that question, if
 he will. (92: 2-93: 0)
 . . .
 Tell him exactly what happened to you. (93: 0)
 ... Make it emphatic that he does not have to agree with your conception of God.
 He can choose any conception he likes, provided it makes sense to him. (93: 0)
 Let him see that you are not there to instruct him in religion. (93: 2)
 Outline the program of action.... (94: 1)
 Make it plain he is under no obligation to...see you again if he doesn't want to.
 (94: 1)
 . . .
 Your candidate may give reasons why he need not follow all of the program. ...
 Do not contradict such views. (94: 2)
 On your first visit tell him about the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. If he
 shows interest, lend him your copy of this book. (94: 2)
 ...Do not wear out your welcome. Give him a chance to think it over. (95: 1)
 ...You will be most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any passion for
 crusade or reform. (95: 1)
 Never talk down to an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay
 out the kit of spiritual tools for his inspection. (95: 1)
 . . .
 Show him how they [the Steps] worked with you. (95: 1)
 Offer him friendship and fellowship. (95: 1)
 Tell him that if he wants to get well you will do anything to help. (95: 1)
 ...If he expects you to act only as a banker...or a nurse for his sprees, you may
 have to drop him.... (95: 2)
 If he is sincerely interested and wants to see you again, ask him to read this book
 in the interval. (95: 3)
 If he thinks he can do the job in some other way...encourage him to follow his own
 conscience. (95: 4)
 . . .
 Suppose now you are making your second visit to a man. He has read this volume
 and says he is prepared to go through with the Twelve Steps of the program of
 recovery. Having had the experience yourself, you can give him much practical
 advice. (96: 2)
 Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should neglect
 his family. ... The family should be offered your way of life. (97: 3)
 The minute we put our work on a ‘service’ plane, the alcoholic commences to rely
 on our assistance…claiming he cannot master alcohol until his material needs
 are cared for. Nonsense. (98: 1)
 Burn the idea into the consciousness of every man that he can get well regardless
 of anyone. (98: 2)
 When working with a man and his family, you should take care not to participate
 in their quarrels. (100: 2)
 We are careful never to show intolerance or hatred of drinking as an institution.
 (103: 1)
 . . .
 Be sober, considerate, and helpful, regardless of what anyone says or does. (99:
 1)
 We may read Chapter 8, To Wives; Chapter 9, The Family Afterwards; Chapter 10, To
 Employers and Chapter 11, A Vision for You. These chapters teach us how to practice
 the Twelve Step principles in all our affairs.
 Some of us may immediately begin working through the Steps again with the
 perspective that we have gained from our journey thus far.
