<h1>Step 6</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>SESSION 14
 STEP 6 Into Action p. 76: 1
 Step 6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
 Let go. (76: 1) We ask God [of our understanding] to help us be willing. (76: 1)
 Step 6 written inventory Take Step 6
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Review Into Action p. 75: 3. Read of Step 6 on p. 76: 1. (See also 263:
 0, 1, 2) Many read Step 6 in the 12 & 12.
 o Have you done the Step work so far to [your] satisfaction? (75: 3-76: 1)
 o Heard in a meeting: “When you were ready, you let your drinking go. You can
 do the same with your other defects and shortcomings.”
 WRITE List all of your character defects from Steps 4 and 5 and write brief
 descriptions of them. [Defect: A lack; an imperfection. To fall short; to miss the
 mark.] [Change: To substitute something else for. To exchange.]
 o You may have become so attached to your defenses, patterns, masks and
 actor’s roles (60: 4) -your defects- that you have begun to identify with them.
 o Yet there comes a point when it is more painful to stay in the old patterns than
 it is to risk something new and unknown.
 o The key to Step 6 is to maintain the honesty developed through all the Steps,
 and to be patient with yourself.
 TALK Call your sponsor and other members of the group to discuss your
 thoughts on Step 6.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION MEDITATION / PRAYER.
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of Step 6?
 [Optional: Having been granted a perfect release from alcoholism, why then
 shouldn't we be able to achieve by the same means a perfect release from every
 other difficulty or defect? This is a riddle…. (12&12 64: 2)]
 Consider having a round robin discussion about one particular defect, and the
 group’s experiences with Step 6 by the Big Book.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 75:3-76: 1) Try saying these out loud.
 1.) Awareness of Character Defects
 In what ways are my defects really basic human traits that have been distorted by
 my own self-centeredness?
 In what specific ways am I addicted to outside things to change my feelings?
 Can I list each defect I have and the ways I act on it?
 How do I feel when I act out on each defect? What feelings do my defects help
 me change or avoid? Is every defect another face of fear?
 What would my life be like without each defect?
 2.) Willingness
 Am I ready to become willing?
 Which of my unwanted defects am I dismayed to find are still here?
 Which of my defects have I had most of my life, and are like survival skills? How
 did each defect (or pattern or defense or role or mask) protect me?
 Which unhealthy behaviors do I seem to repeat over and over?
 Do I fear I cannot change? Does my personality seem to equal my defects?
 How have I changed so far? What defects do I no longer have to act on?
 Can I see the principles of 12 Step recovery as being the opposite of my character
 defects?
 Am I entirely ready (59: 2) to let my higher power set my character defects at one
 remove from me?
 3.) Letting Go
 When will the pain of holding on to my defects of character become greater than
 my fear of change?
 Have many of my thought-habits brought nothing but pain and degradation to my
 life? Do I need help in dealing with them?
 How may I let go through prayer and meditation and reflect on my higher power?
 How does my surrender deepen in this step? Can I relax since I do not do it alone?
 What action can I take that shows that I am entirely ready?
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 6 PRINCIPLES
 How may I demonstrate my commitment to persevere in my recovery today?
 How am I willing to act differently?
 How may I increase my trust in the God of my understanding by working Step 6?
 How may I practice the principle of self-acceptance, even when once again I act
 on a defect against my will?
 Can I not do what the alcoholic in me says, “I want to do” today?
 Do I understand this is just for today, one day at a time?

 IV TAKE STEP 6 We take Step 6 in the first paragraph on BB page 76.
 -See page 95 of this workbook for an optional Step 6 written inventory.
 As we put our willingness to change into practice, one day at a time, then according to
 the Big Book, and under the conditions of this day, we take Step 6.
 Observe carrying out Step 6 in the manner that your group sees fit.
