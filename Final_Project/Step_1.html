<h1>Step 1</h1>

<h3>Worksheet:</h3>

<p>18 http://stepsbybigbook.net Step 1
SESSION 1
Preface and Forewords
A wonderfully effective spiritual structure can be built. (47: 2)
I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read the Table of Contents, Preface, and the Forewords to the First,
Second, Third, and Fourth Editions of the Big Book. Many will read the
Foreword to Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions (12&12) as well.
 WRITE Consider the focus questions relating to the readings, and write
reflective answers to them, as you see fit. Cross off the bulleted comments as you
take them in. Include your own questions and observations, and explore your
doubts as well as your certainties in detail and in depth.
 TALK Talk with your sponsor and/or buddy about the process you are about
to undertake.
II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me
 about my practice of the 12 Steps?
 We discuss the purpose, plan and session format of this Steps by the Big Book
group course. Consider that each member is expected to not only talk about but to
do each of the Steps and, if possible, to attend every session with the team.
 This is a commitment, a team effort. Together we can do it!
 We discuss how the Big Book readings influence our own recovery process.
Points of Focus and Reflection
1.) Contents -A repeating mighty purpose and rhythm (10: 3) of the Steps and of the
Big Book can be seen even on the Contents page (Consider page v).
 „The Problem‟ is set out in Doctor‟s Opinion and Chapter 1. [See 17: 1; 19: 3]
 „The Solution‟ is introduced in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. [See also 17: 3; 25: 1]
 „The Program of Action‟ is described in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. [See also 9:6; 42: 2]
 2.) 1955 Foreword to Second Edition (Consider pp. xv: 3-xvii: 2; xix: 1; xxi: 0)
 What do the Big Book authors mean when they say that, this is but a beginning,
only the augury of a much larger future ahead? (xv: 2)
 How am I part of that future? What do I know about the story of AA?
 What were the tenets of the Oxford Groups? (xvi: 0) [See also 263: 0]
 What is the message of AA? (xvii: 3; xviii: 0; xxi: 0) [See also xvi: 2; 17: 3; 45: 2;
60: 0; 77: 0; 89 :1]
 What are the principles by which the individual alcoholic could live? (xix: 1)
 What are the principles by which AA groups and AA as a whole could survive and
function? (xix: 1)
 What is the alternative to the high road? (xxi: 0)
http://stepsbybigbook.net Step 1 19
SESSION 2
STEP 1 The Doctor’s Opinion
Step 1: We admitted we were powerless over alcohol – that our lives had become
unmanageable.
…Physical craving for liquor. (xxvii: 7 - xxviii: 0)
They cannot…differentiate the true from the false. (xxviii: 4)
I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read The Doctor‟s Opinion. Many will read Step 1 in the 12&12.
 WRITE As part of your Step 1 written inventory begin to write about:
o Your own definition of each word in this Step, and every Step. Then look up
each word individually in the dictionary.
o Write what each part means to you: We admit that we are powerless over our
alcoholism-addiction and that our lives [and minds] have been and are
unmanageable.
o “How am I powerless over alcohol? Even if I have been sober for a
significant length of time, over what am I powerless?”
o “How is my life unmanageable today?”
 TALK Talk with your sponsor and other members of the group about the
readings and your reflections on them.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH MEDITATION / PRAYER
You may follow the Big Book and 12&12 suggestions for meditation and prayer,
or choose a practice that is in line with your own belief system. The goal is to set
aside some quiet reflection time, perhaps 15-20 minutes twice a day.
II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me about
my practice of Step 1?
 As we each go about our daily activities, we think about the people, places, and
things that are unmanageable, or over which we are powerless. Each day we
write: “I cannot control / have no power over________.”
 We also list what we can control and what we do have power over.
 We share our lists with the group.
Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider pp. xxvi: 3-xxix: 3) Try them out loud.
Consider avoiding 'yes' and 'no' rote answers, and responding fully in detail and in depth.
The Problem as understood by Dr. Silkworth in the Doctor‟s Opinion.
 1.) The mental obsession (xxviii: 4) [(L obsession- siege) preoccupation, fixed idea]
 2.) The physical compulsion [physical craving or allergy (xxx: 0), compelled to act]
 3.) The using to excess [abuse: spree (xxix: 0)], and the need to control our
 drinking.
 4.) The need for a psychic change. (xxix: 1, 3) (Also xxvii: 4; xxviii: 2; xxxi: 4)
20 http://stepsbybigbook.net Step 1
1.) Mental Obsession [Mind: unmanageable (59: 2)]
 How am I affected by Dr. Silkworth‟s definition of alcoholism as a medical
problem? (xxx: 0) [Disease: (L- To lack ease.) Involuntary disability. See 64: 3]
 Did I drink essentially because [I] like the effect produced by alcohol? (xxviii: 4)
 Have I been restless, irritable, and discontented? (xxviii: 4)
 Have I sought the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few
drinks? (xxix: 0)
 Describe in detail how I succumbed to the desire again? (xxix: 0)
 In what ways did I reach the point where I could not differentiate the true from the
false? (xxviii: 4)
 When did I first experience an abnormal mental obsession with alcohol? Describe.
2.) Physical Compulsion [Body: powerless (59: 2)]
 How did I develop the physical…phenomenon of craving [allergy]? (xxvii: 7 -
xxviii: 0,1; xxix: 0, 4; xxx: 1, 5)
 How do I describe my pathological physical reaction to alcohol?
 In what ways has my alcoholic body become as sick as my alcoholic mind? (xxvi:
2)
 What is my understanding of the concept of alcoholism as the manifestation of an
allergy? (xxviii: 1) [Allergy (Gr allos – strange): An abnormal reaction.]
 How do I feel about the idea of hospitalization? (xxvi: 4; xxviii: 0)
 When did I first experience a physical compulsion or craving for alcohol?
Describe.
3.) Drinking to Excess:
 In what ways did I pass through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging
remorseful, with a firm resolution not to drink again? (xxix: 0)
 In what ways did I repeat this over and over? (xxix: 0)
 What are my reflections on the ideas that alcoholism has never
been…permanently eradicated; and that the only relief…is entire abstinence?
(xxx: 5)
 When did I first experience the loss of control of my drinking? Describe.
4.) Psychic Change
 What is my understanding of a psychic change? (xxix: 1, 3)
 What is meant by being required to follow a few simple rules? (xxix: 1)
 Am I aware that, if I have been abstinent from alcohol a while, Step 1 is about my
powerlessness over some other behavior or thought-habit that reflects the
unmanageability of my life and mind?
 Am I aware that I need to find a way to stop that behavior so that my surrender is
not blocked by continued acting out?
 What is of significance to me in this chapter? What do I not agree with?
http://stepsbybigbook.net Step 1 21
SESSION 3
STEP 1 Bill’s Story
Step 1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol – that our lives had become
unmanageable.
Upon a foundation of complete willingness…. (12: 4)
…the mental twist which leads to the first drink of a spree. (92: 0)
Step 1 written inventory
I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the the Big Book authors say?
 READ Chapter 1 Bill‟s Story, pp.1 – 16. Read in the Big Book how in 1934
one of AA's founders, Bill W., learned of the problem, the solution, and the
program of action to recover from alcoholism.
o 1. The Problem: From Dr. Silkworth, Bill learned of the medical problem of
alcoholism as both a mental and a physical illness. (7:1; xxv-xxxii)
o 2. The Solution: From Dr. Carl Jung, (through Roland H. and Ebby T.) Bill
learned of the spiritual solution to the problem as a necessary vital spiritual
experience. (27: 5; see also 9: 6; 567-8)
o 3. The Program of Action: From the Oxford Group (through Ebby T.), Bill
learned of the discipline of practicing a step by step program of principles and
action that opens one to the necessary vital spiritual experiences. (27: 4) [See
also He Sold Himself Short, 263: 0]
 WRITE Write down how the matters set forth in Bill‟s Story reflect your own
life.
o Cross off the bulleted focus and reflection comments as you consider them.
o Continue writing your Step 1 inventory about your powerlessness over alcohol
and how your life is unmanageable.
 TALK Speak with your sponsor and other group members about the study
group and the Step 1 readings.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH MEDITATION / PRAYER
II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me about
my practice of Step 1?
 We review selections from Bill's Story together.
 We each consider sharing our own writings and personal Step 1 stories with the
group.
 Rather than 'yes' and 'no' responses, consider answering in detail and with
examples.
22 http://stepsbybigbook.net Step 1
Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 2: 2; 3: 2; 5: 4-6: 1; 8: 1-9: 6; 12: 2-14: 6)
1.) The Problem (17: 1)
 What did Bill mean by, I commenced to forge the weapon…that one day would
turn…like a boomerang and…cut me to ribbons? (2: 2)
 Was there a time for me when liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity?
(5: 1)
 Did I think I could control the situation? (5: 1)
 Did I ever wonder, Was I crazy? (5: 5)
 How does an appalling lack of perspective relate to sanity, honesty, or humility?

48: 0; 58: 1; 72: 2]
 In what specific ways did I feel the remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next
morning? (6: 1)

 In what ways did I seek oblivion? (6: 1)
 In what ways have I felt fear? (6: 2, 7: 0)
 What are my reflections on Dr. Silkworth's proposition that we have been
seriously ill, bodily and mentally? (7: 1)
 Did I see that I could not take so much as one drink? (5: 4)
 Did such self-knowledge (7: 2) of the problem of the insanity of that first drink (8:
2) alone keep me sober?
 Bill describes taking Step 1 by admitting, Alcohol was my master. (8: 1)
 In what ways has alcohol been my master? (8: 1)
2.) The Solution (17: 3)
 What is my understanding of the simple religious idea? (9: 6)
 What was my reaction to‟ religion‟, „the church‟, and „God‟? (10: 1)
 How do I react to the suggestion, Why don’t you choose your own conception of
God? (12: 2; 46: 2)
 Bill takes Step 2 when he understands that, nothing more was required...to make
my beginning than being willing to believe. (12: 4)
 Note that Bill was instructed to sit quietly and to test [his] thinking by the new
God-consciousness within. (13: 4)
3.) The Program of Action (9: 6)
 What is my understanding of the practical program of action? (9: 6)
 How did this derive from the non-alcoholic Oxford Groups of that day? ( xvi: 0;
and see 263: 0)
 What are the essential requirements, as I understand them? (13: 5 - 14: 0)
 How do I understand, It meant destruction of self-centeredness? (14: 1)
 What were the revolutionary and drastic proposals? (14: 2)
 Note that Bill essentially takes Step 3 through Step 12 at this time while still in
the hospital. [Step 1 (8: 1); Step 2 (12: 4); Steps 3-11 (13: 2-4); Step 12 (1st part
13: 5; 2nd part 14: 5, 6)]

SESSION 4
STEP 1 & 2 There is a Solution
Step 1 We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become
unmanageable.
Step 2 Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to
sanity.
Fellowship… …the powerful cement which binds us. (17: 2)
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY – What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ: Read Chapter 2, There is a Solution and Appendix II, Spiritual
 Experience in the Big Book.
 WRITE: Continue to write about how you are powerless over alcohol, and why
 your life is unmanageable (then and now). Respond to at least three or four of the
 optional focus questions, and to ones of your own.
 TALK: Talk with your sponsor and other group members about powerlessness.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH MEDITATION / PRAYER
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me about
 my practice of Step 1 and Step 2?
 Letting go of the illusion that we can control our addictive behavior on our own is
 the first step on the way to recovery.
 Only when we realize we cannot control our using do we find a way to change, a
 way out.
 We each consider sharing our own written reflections on Steps 1 & 2 with the
 other members of the group. Pick a topic that interests all or several members of
 the group and engage in a round robin discussion.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 17: 2-18: 4; 20: 1-23: 1; 25: 1-3; 27: 2-28: 3)
 1.) The Power of the Fellowship
 How do I understand the fellowship as the powerful cement which binds us? (17: 2)
 How have I experienced the common solution, the way out? (17: 3)
 Did my alcoholic illness engulf all whose lives touch the sufferer's? (18: 1)
 How is it that I can win the entire confidence of another alcoholic? (18: 4)
 2.) The Real Alcoholic
 In what ways do I have a hopeless condition of mind and body? (20: 1)
 What is my reaction to the idea that a real alcoholic is one who loses all control
 of his liquor consumption once he begins to drink? (21: 1)
 Am I a real alcoholic? (21: 1) If not, why not? If so, describe fully.
 Did I have control over alcohol?
 What absurd, incredible and tragic things did I do while drinking? (21: 2)
 In what respects have I been dishonest and selfish? (21: 2)
 Have I been a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? (21: 2) Describe.
 When have I searched madly for the bottle? (22: 0)
 Have I used a combination of …sedative and liquor? (22: 0)
 Can I answer the riddle of why I took that one drink, that first drink, over and
 over? (22: 3; 22: 2; 23: 1)
 How do I respond to the premise that the main problem of the alcoholic centers in
 his mind, rather than his body? (23: 1)
 In what ways do I share the malady of the lie, the mental obsession that somehow,
 someday [I can] beat the game and take one drink? (23: 2; 22: 2) [See also 326: 2)
 In what specific ways have I lost the power of choice in drink? (24: 1)
 3.) The Spiritual Experience
 In what ways is my being sober today evidence of having tapped an unsuspected
 inner resource which I may identify with [my own] conception of a Power greater
 than [myself]? (567: 4-568: 0)
 In what ways had I come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as I had
 been living it? (25: 1) Describe in detail.
 Have I felt I had but two alternatives:?
 o One was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the consciousness of our
 intolerable situation…
 o …and the other, to accept spiritual help? (25: 3 )
 How does one go about accepting spiritual help? Might one‟s spiritual life then
 include our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs?
 (20: 0) Can I accept that the concept of “others” includes me?
 Am I ready for the self-searching, the leveling of [my] pride and the confession of
 shortcomings that the process requires? (25: 1) (See also 42:1, 2; 64: 1; 122: 1)
 What was the certain simple attitude (27:0) that allowed the utterly
 hopeless…drunk (26: 1, 3) to become a free man? ((26: 4; 28: 1) [See 28: 3
 willing and honest enough to try.]
 How do Dr. Carl Jung's reflections on vital spiritual experiences as the solution to
 our problem apply to my recovery? (27: 4, 5)
 How might William James‟ Varieties of Religious Experience be of use to me?
 (28: 3)
 Have I experienced the presence of a higher power? Be specific.
 SESSION 5
 STEP 1 & 2 More About Alcoholism
 Step 1. We admitted that we were powerless over alcohol – that our lives had
 become unmanageable.
 Step 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to
 sanity.
 We were alcoholics (30: 2; see also 60: 2)
 Take Step 1
 I ON YOUR OWN: STUDY What did the Big Book authors say?
 READ Read of relapse in Chapter 3, More About Alcoholism.
 WRITE Write the story of your last drink in detail or tell aspects of your story
 through several drinking episodes. .
 o You may focus on these or other points in your written reflections:
 -The Starting Problem: Our mental obsession. („The Lie‟) There came the time
 that we were stone cold sober and we picked up even though we had years of experience
 about where it would lead us. The subtle insanity which precedes the first drink. (40: 2)
 -The Stopping Problem: Our physical compulsion (craving, “allergy”). That once
 we put the drink into our system there was never enough, we could not stop.
 -How we drank to excess: Why? Because we are alcoholic. (30: 2) [See also 342: 1]
 TALK Talk with your sponsor or with other members of your group.
 PRACTICE DAILY RELAXATION WITH MEDITATION / PRAYER
 II WITH THE GROUP: PRACTICE – What does the Big Book say to me about
 my practice of Step 1 and Step 2?
 We talk with other group members about relapse. Did any of the stories in this chapter
 move us more than others did? Have we ever faced a situation where only our higher
 power stood between us and a drink? (43: 3) Have we ever relapsed? Describe in depth.
 Points of Focus and Reflection (Consider 32: 2-34: 2; 35: 1-38: 2; 39: 2-43: 3)
 1.) The Man of Thirty
 Do I have a reservation of any kind, [or] any lurking notions that someday [I] will
 be immune to alcohol? (33: 1)
 Was I astonished at [my] inability to stop? (33: 3)
 Had I lost the power to choose?(34: 2)
 Like the man of thirty, did I have an utter inability to leave it alone? (34: 2)
 2.) Jim
 What mental states are the crux of the [drinking] problem? (35: 0)
 Can I identify with Jim who found himself drunk even after accepting what others
 knew of alcoholism [Step 1], and the answer [they] had found [Step 2]? (35: 3)
 Have I been crazy and insane?(see 5: 5; 37: 1; 38: 1, 2)
 Was I able to stop drinking on the basis of self-knowledge? (39: 1)
 3.) The Jaywalker
 Are my thought-habits and behaviors absurd and incomprehensible? (37: 4)
 How have I been strangely insane? (38: 2)
 4.) Fred
 Can I identify with Fred, who would not believe himself an alcoholic [Step 1],
 much less accept a spiritual remedy for his problem [Step 2]? (39: 2)
 Was I told that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time and place would come – I
 would drink again? (41: 2-42: 0)
 What are the spiritual answer and the program of action? (42: 2)
 What are my thoughts about the idea that the alcoholic at certain times has no
 effective mental defense against the first drink? (43: 3)
 III DAILY PRACTICE OF STEP 1 PRINCIPLES:
 Do I know that admitting powerlessness does not mean admitting worthlessness?
 How may I accept my new freedom in no longer having to lie about my drinking?
 How may I stay in touch with the reality of my disease, no matter how long I have
 been free from drinking?
 In what ways today have I begun to be honest in recovery?
 Can I tell my sponsor or someone else when I have been thinking about drinking
 or acting out on my disease in some other way?
 How am I practicing open-mindedness, humility, and willingness today?
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 IV TAKE STEP 1 Take Step 1 in the second paragraph of BB page 30.
 …We had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics. This
 is the first step in recovery. (30: 2)
 This is how the Big Book authors described taking Step 1. If we concede, then
 according to the Big Book and under the conditions of this day, we take Step 1. As with
 all of the Steps, we each take Step 1 when we each say so.
 Some write a statement such as this:
 “I admit I am powerless over ___________________. My life is unmanageable.”
